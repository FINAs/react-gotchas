# React Gotchas

This repository is meant to be a way to collaboratively track **gotchas** -- easy-to-miss mistakes that can cause large headaches down the road. File a PR!

## Caveat

While the tips here are meant to be general-purpose, several of the items listed are specific to RocketFuel's code base and are marked as such.

Much of the material is biased by my opinion as I am currently the only contributor. Any comments, concerns, or disagreements are very welcome in the Issues section.
